### Severely undocumented repo, future updates will fix this.

## About

This projects aims to create a traffic simulator for Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The firsts steps are to choose a zone to represent(in this case Mihai Viteazu Square, main central area of the town as seen in the printscreen below) on the scene(canvas) and create a prototype that will be used in the near future to develop the traffic AI and roads and road logic.
